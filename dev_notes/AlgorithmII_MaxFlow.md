## Mincut problem

 - Input
    - An edge-weighted digraph, source vertex s, and target vertex t
 - Def.
    - A **st-cut (cut)** is a partition of the vertices into two disjoint sets, with s in one set A and t in the other set B. 
 - Def.
    - Its **capacity** is the sum of the capacities of the edges from A to B.
