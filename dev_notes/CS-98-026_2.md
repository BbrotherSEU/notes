## Mappers and ROMs

 - iNES Header
 - Bank Switching
 - MMC3

### iNES Header

 - Information about the ROM
    - Number of PRG banks (16k each)
    - Number of CHR banks (8k, 2 tables each)
    - Mirroring Type (0 = horizontal, 1 = vertical)
    - Memory Mapper (0 = none, 4 = MMC3)
 - Check out header.bas in the demo ROMs

### Bank Switching 

 - The NES can only address 64k of memory
 - Only 32k is for ROM (code and data)
 - Large games need to be able to swap areas of memory in and out
 - Usually have a 16k bank for code and swap 16k of level data
 - Memory mappers let us swap the memory

### Bank Boundaries

 - In ROM source, you may use assembly to declare bank boundaries
 - Banks usually have a base address of $8000 or $C000

```
asm
    .org $8000 //base address
    .bank 0 //0 = first bank
endasm
```

## MMC3

 - iNES Mapper #4
 - Extra memory capability for battery-backed save RAM
 - Allows swapping 8k blocks of PRG memory
 - Allows swapping 64- or 128-tile blocks of CHR pattern table
 - Allows name table mirror type switching
 - Common, versatile, and easy to use
 - SMB2, SMB3, SOF, Megaman 3-6, many others

---
 
 - Splits PRG region ($8000-$ffff) into 4 banks of 8k each
 - You can swap the lower banks or the middle banks with other ROM banks. 
    - Upper bank is **hardwired** to the last bank in the ROM.
 - I suggest you locate your game code in the upper banks and swap the lower banks for level data


### MMC3 Usage

 - MMC3 Support code 
    - [MMC3 Memory Mapper Support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mebusy/notes/master/codes/nbasic_codes/mmc3.bas)
 - Example to swap lower 8k of PRG memory

```
gosub mmc3_use_lower_banks //use lower banks
set mmc3_command 6 //swap to first 8k bank
set mmc3_pagenum 0 //copy from first 8k of ROM
gosub mmc3_execute_command //swap
```

 - Example to swap first 128 tiles of first pattern table
 - Read the source file to see available commands and functions

```
set mmc3_command 0 //swap 2k page to PPU $0000
set mmc3_pagenum 4 //letâ€™s copy from here
gosub mmc3_execute_command //go!
```
