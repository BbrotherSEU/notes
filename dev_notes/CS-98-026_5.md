## Sound: WTF is nesmus doing?

 - call nesmus_loop each frame
 - nesmus binary format
    - Types: start/end loop, note data
    - Which channels are affected
    - 4 bytes data per channe

## Music Channels

### Music Channel Enable

 - Use bitmask to register to enable/disable sound channels
 - set $4015 %1111 
    - enables all four channels
 - set $4015 %11111
    - enable all five channels (DMC PCM)
 - set $4017 %10000000
    - probably want this, for correct pitch

### Music Channels 0-1

 - Square waves ($4000-$4003, $4004-$4007)
 - Important things to note
    - volume (byte 0, bits 0-3)
    - length counter enable (byte 0, bit 5)
    - length counter load (byte 3, bits 3-7)
    - wavelength (11-bit value) 

### Music Wavelength

 - Wavelength is an ugly 11-bit value based on clock cycles
 - 8 LSB of wavelength (byte 2)
 - 3 MSB of wavelength (byte 3, bits 0-2)

### Pitch to Wavelength

 - Clock cycles are counted at 1.79 MHz
 - Sound uses the internal 60 Hz LFO for clock, instead of internal 240 Hz LFO
 - This and other funkiness magically gives us a sound-specific clock rate of 1.79 MHz / 16
 - Musicians are likely to want a specific frequency (in Hz).We need an easy formula to convert to the ugly 11-bit wavelength.

```
ugly number = (1.79 MHz / 16) / freq - 1
            = (111875 / freq) - 1
```

### Demonstration

 - calculate
    - A 440
    - 111875 / 440 - 1 = 253.261
    - binary(253) = %11111101
 - use sndtest.nes to test
