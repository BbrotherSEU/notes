## NES resolution

 - 248x240 visible
 - From the programmer's perspective, the NES has a resolution of 256x256, 
    - but it chops off 8 pixels on each side, and 16 pixels on the bottom.

## NES Color Palettes

 - 64 Colors in the system palette (not fully unique)
 - 16 Colors in the background palette
 - 16 Colors in the foreground palette
 

### NES Sub Palettes

 - Background and Foreground palettes are split into four sub palettes of 4 colors.
 - The first entry in each background sub palette is the same **primary background color**.
    - This primary background color is usually used for the sky color
    - but it can also be used as the transparent color, in the rare event that you may wish to draw a sprite “behind” the background.
 - The first entry in each foreground sub palette is transparent.

 - Sprites and background tiles are 2-bit color (**4 colors max**).
 - Each pixel color value is a lookup index ,  into the current active sub palette for that tile
 - This allows the primary color and 3 unique colors per background sub palette.
 - Each foreground sub palette has 3 nontransparent colors.
 - The game is allowed to change the palettes and sub palettes during play, 
    - and sprites and tiles may change which sub palette they use for drawing.
 - How many colours can the NES display at once?
    - Ordinarily, the NES can display 13 different background colours, and 12 different sprite colours, giving a total of 25 colours on-screen, at once
    - However, using PPU trickery, one can display all of the NES' 64 palette values at once.

## NES Sprites

 - 8x8 or 8x16 pixels
    - However, only one size may be active at a time. 
 - May be flipped horizontally or vertically.
 - 3 colors and transparency
    - However, you may cleverly draw multiple sprites on top of each other, to create the appearance of a single sprite with more colors
 - Maximum of 64 sprites on screen at once
 - Hardware limit of 8 sprites per scanline
 - Not all emulators respect the 8 sprite limit

## Image Scaling

 - NES has a fixed resolution of 256x240
 - Your monitor is bigger
 - Playing games in a tiny window is no fun
 - hq3x seems good

## How a Game Works

 - Initialization
    - Set up graphics
    - Set initial values
 - The Game Loop
    - Draw the screen
    - Get player input
    - Calculate the next frame

## Example nbasic Game

```
start:
    gosub init_screen
    gosub init_vars
mainloop:
    gosub vwait //wait for next frame
    gosub draw_stuff //draw the new frame
    gosub handle_joystick //get input
    gosub calculate_things //game logic
    gosub update_sound //make some noise
    goto mainloop
```


## NES Registers

#### Common Registers

address | desc
--- | ---
$2000, $2001  | PPU Initialization
$2003, $2004  | Sprite Control
$2005  | Scrolling
$2006  | PPU Memory Address
$2007  | PPU Memory Access
$4014  | Sprite DMA
$4000-$400F  | Music Control
$4015  | Sound Setup
$4016, $4017  | Joysticks


### Joystick Input

 - Joystick 1 is register $4016
 - Joystick 2 is register $4017
 - Strobe by writing 1 then 0 to port ?
