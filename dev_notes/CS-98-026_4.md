## Drawing the Level

 - You may be tempted to have code such as:

```
set $2007 1
set $2007 5
set $2007 1
...
set $2007 4
```

 - This works, but is generally a bad idea

 - Use a load function to read that data

```
load_level:
    //do stuff here
    return
level_data:
    asm
    .incbin “level.dat”
    endasm
```

## use RLE Compression for save ROM size

## Sound Effects

 - Check the webpage for NES Sound Test
    - https://github.com/mebusy/codeLib/blob/master/CS-98-026/tools/sndtest.nes
 - This ROM lets you set the bits any sound channel and immediately hear what it sounds like.
 - Play around with it to create your sound effects.
 - Write down the values when you make a sound you like

```
;       Select:     Select channel
;       Up/Down:    Select register of current channel
;       Right/Left: Select bit of current register
;       A:          Toggle current bit
;       Start:      Play channel
```

### some samples to start you off

```
init_sound:
    set $4015 0 //turn off all channels
    set $4015 %00011111 //turn them back on
    return

playsound_jump:
    set $4000 %10011000
    set $4001 %10001100
    set $4002 %01001101
    set $4003 %10010101
    return

playsound_squish:
    set $4000 %10001000
    set $4001 %01001000
    set $4002 %00100101
    set $4003 %01001011
    return

playsound_thump:
    set $4000 %10011111
    set $4001 %10000100
    set $4002 %11010011
    set $4003 %11111100
    return
```

## Programming Palettes

 - Loader function
 - data array

```
load_palette:
    set $2006 $3f
    set $2006 0
    set x 0
    load_palette_1:
        set $2007 [palette x]
        inc x
        if x < 32 branchto load_palette_1
    return
palette:
    data 0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3
    data 0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3
```

### Multiple Palettes

 - You may want the palette to change when something important happens
 - Easy approach: multiple load functions, multiple palette data arrays

```
load_overworld_palette:
    //do some stuff
    return
load_evil_palette:
    //do some stuff
    return
overworld_palette:
     //some data
evil_palette:
     //some data
```

### Palette Cycling

 - Sometimes you want certain colors to change over time 
    - gold coins in Mario, player gets hurt and flashes
 - Every frame, or every few frames, change part of the palette
 - When called each frame, this code will make one palette color cycle through shades of gold every 8 frame
 - Powers of 2 are easy cycle times to work with

```
cycle_coin_color:
    set $2006 $3f
    set $2006 19 //foreground color 3
    set which_color & current_frame %111
    set $2007 [coin_colors which_color]
    inc current_frame
    return
coin_colors:
    data $18,$26,$27,$28,$28,$27,$26,$18
```

### Scene Change Palette

 - A scene change (new level, going through a door) often needs to redraw the whole background
 - Rewriting an entire name table cannot be done in a single vblank
 - You need to either take several frames or turn off the PPU during that time
 - If you take several frames to draw, blanking the palette can avoid unsightly graphics

## Sprite 0 Hit Tricks

 - Many games use `split screen scrolling` to scroll one part of the screen and have a static status bar at the top or bottom
 - You may be able to detect multiple times and locations in a frame, if you want to be really cool

### Sprite 0 Usage

 - Bit 6 of $2002 tells sprite 0 hit status
 - Three loops for proper usage
    - Wait for end of vblank
    - Wait for bit 6 to clear
    - Wait for bit 6 to hit
 - There’s some code on the webpage for you
